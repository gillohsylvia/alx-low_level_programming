## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  * [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c): C program that prints whether
  a randomly generated number is positive or negative, followed by a new line:
    * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c).
    * Stores a different random number every time the program is run.
    * Prints the number followed by `is positive` if the number is greater than 0, `is zero` if the number is zero, or `is negative` if the number is less than 0.

* **1. The last digit**
  * [1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c): C program that prints the last digit of a
  randomly generated number, followed by a new line:
    * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c).
    * Stores a different value every time the program is run.
    * Prints the string `Last digit of` [number] `is` [last_digit] `and is` followed
    by `greater than 5` if the digit is greater than 5, `0` if the digit is 0, or
    `less than 6 and not 0` if the digit is less than 6 and not 0.

* **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  * [2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c): C program that prints the alphabet in
  lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.

* **3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  * [3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c): C program that prints the alphabet in
  lowercase, then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar`
  function exactly three times.

* **4. alphABET**
  * [4-print_alphabt.c](./4-print_alphabt.c): C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase
  except for the letters `q` and `e`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar`
  function exactly twice.

* **5. Numbers**
  * [5-print_numbers.c](./5-print_numbers.c): C program that prints all single digit numbers
  of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

* **6. Numberz**
  * [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c): C program that prints all single digit numbers
  of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function
  exactly twice without any variables of type `char`.

* **7. Smile in the mirror**
  * [7-print_tebahpla.c](./7-print_tebahpla.c): C program that prints the lowercase alphabet
  in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.

* **8. Hexadecimal**
  * [8-print_base16.c](./8-print_base16.c): C program that prints all the numbers of base
  16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly three
  times.

* **9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
  * [9-print_comb.c](./9-print_comb.c): C program that prints all possible combinations of
  single-digit numbers, using only the `putchar` function exactly four times without any
  variables of type `char`:
    * Numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
    * Numbers are printed in ascending order.

* **10. 00...99**
  * [10-print_comb2.c](./10-print_comb2.c): C program that prints the numbers from `00`
  to `99` using only the `putchar` function exactly five times without any variables of
  type `char`:
    * Numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
    * Numbers are printed in ascending order, with two digits.

* **11. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
  * [100-print_comb3.c](./100-print_comb3.c): C program that prints all possible different
  combinations of two digits using only the `putchar` function exactly five times without any
  variables of type `char`:
    * Numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
    * The two digits are different.
    * `01` and `10` are considered the same combination of the two digits `0` and `1`.
    * Prints only the smallest combination of two digits.
    * Numbers are printed in ascending order.

* **12. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...**
